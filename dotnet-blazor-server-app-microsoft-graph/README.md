# .NET v7.0 Blazor Server app connected to Microsoft Graph

This is a template for a Blazor app built using .NET v7.0 that connects to Microsoft Graph.

## Minimal Path to Awesome ðŸš€

Follow the instructions to successfully run your Blazor Server app with Microsoft Graph.

### 1. Register an Azure Active Directory app

Every app that uses Azure AD for authentication must be registered with Azure AD. You can register app through Azure Portal or by using Azure CLI. Please follow one of the options to register your app:

<details>
  <summary>Option 1: Register an app by using Azure CLI</summary>

* [Install Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest) if you haven't already.
* Register your app on Microsoft Azure, by creating a new Azure AD app registration:
  * <details>
      <summary>On macOS/Linux/in Bash</summary>

    * Open terminal and change the working directory to the root of this project
    * To make the setup script executable, run `chmod +x ./setup.sh`
    * To register the app, run `./setup.sh`
    * When prompted, sign in with your **Microsoft 365 developer sandbox account**

    </details>
  * <details>
      <summary>On Windows/in PowerShell</summary>

    * Open PowerShell and change the working directory to the root of this project
    * To register the app, run `.\setup.ps1`
    * When prompted, sign in with your **Microsoft 365 developer sandbox account**

    </details>

</details>

<details>

  <summary>Option 2: Register an app through Azure Portal</summary>

* Go to [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) and login with your testing account that has Application developer or administrator permissions.
* Select **Azure Active Directory**, and select **App Registrations** from the left side bar. Then select **+ New registration**.
* Give any name to your app. For **Supported account types**, select **Accounts in any organizational directory (Any Azure AD directory - Multitenant) and personal Microsoft accounts (e.g. Skype, Xbox)**.
* Set the **Redirect URI** drop down to **Web** and enter `https://localhost:5001/signin-oidc`. Then, select **Register**.
* Select **Certificates & secrets** tab in your registered app, and then **Client secrets**. Create a **New client secret** that never expires.

Make note of the **secret's value** as you'll use it in the next step. Also, navigate to **Overview tab** and make a note of the **Application (client) ID** and **Directory (tenant) ID**. You'll use them in the next steps.

</details>

### 2. Run your Blazor Server app

* Clone the Hack Together repository to your local workspace or directly download the source code.
* Update app and secret (only if in the previous step you registered your app manually)
  * Open the project folder `dotner-blazor-server-app-microsoft-graph` with the editor of your choice. (Visual Studio Code is recommended.)
  * Navigate to your Blazor app in your editor, and select *appsettings.json* file, replace:
    * "CLIENT_ID" with `Secret's value`
    * "CLIENT_SECRET" with `Application (client) ID`
* If you haven't done it previously, register a developer SSL certificate for dotnet apps. In your terminal, run the following command:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet dev-certs https --trust
  ```

* In your terminal, run the following command:

  ```dotnetcli
  dotnet run
  ```

In your browser, navigate to `https://localhost:5001` , and log in using an Azure AD user account to see the app running.

After the login, you'll see your email address on the panel of your app:

![Blazor Server App](/templates/dotnet-blazor-server-app-microsoft-graph/blazorServerApp.png)

Navigate to *Pages* folder in your app, and then *ShowProfile.razor* page. Observe the Microsoft Graph API request in the code to retrieve user email:

```csharp

@page "/showprofile"

@using Microsoft.Identity.Web
@using Microsoft.Graph
@inject Microsoft.Graph.GraphServiceClient GraphServiceClient
@inject MicrosoftIdentityConsentAndConditionalAccessHandler ConsentHandler

<h1>Me</h1>

<p>This component demonstrates fetching data from a service.</p>

@if (user == null)
{
    <p><em>Loading...</em></p>
}
else
{
    <table class="table table-striped table-condensed" style="font-family: monospace">
        <tr>
            <th>Property</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Name</td>
            //user profile information is shown in the UI
            <td>@user.DisplayName</td> 
        </tr>
    </table>
}

@code {
    User? user;

    protected override async Task OnInitializedAsync()
    {
        try
        {    //Microsoft Graph API request to retrieve user profile
            user = await GraphServiceClient.Me.Request().GetAsync(); 
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            ConsentHandler.HandleException(ex);
        }
    }
}
```
