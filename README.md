# .NET-Graph-Hack-Together

## Project Details

I decided to work on from **Create personal tasks in Microsoft To-Do** the [top MS Graph scenarios list](https://github.com/microsoft/hack-together/blob/main/top-scenarios.md) but with a twist that I do it through talking about a project.

I made a Blazor Server app that lets you do a personal standup on your projects, use AI to extract the tasks and add them to Microsoft To Dos, with each project being a list.

### Why I made this

I plan my day every morning, automatically adding these tasks using my voice is way easier than manually typing them down.

### Technologies used

- .NET 7
- .NET Blazor Server
- Open AI Api
- Microsoft Graph .NET SDK
